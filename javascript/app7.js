//   The basic idea
// You are going to create a simple card game in which a player will be 
// able to battle the autoplayer. The game will deal 3 cards (each of which 
//has a damage value) to the player and three cards to the autoplayer. 
//The player will choose a card, and the computer will randomly choose 
//a card, and whichever's card has the highest value will win the point.
//A round is finished once this has happened three times.
// Hint/reminder: use a property when you want to "keep track" of something
// Or should you create a method?
// Hint/reminder: use a method when you want to "do" something
